## Creating and Managing Tasks

**Creating tasks**
There are three ways to create tasks in Across

 2. Use the slash command `/Across` in any channel tracked by Across
 3. Mark the message that you want to turn into a ticket with the üé´ emoji

When you create tasks, they go to a central channel #across_tasks. You can edit/resolve/respond to them from there with your team. You can also filter through tasks in the Home tab - just click the tasks button.

**Associating tasks with multiple customers**

A task can be associated with multiple customers. To add additional customers, select a ticket in your dashboard at acrossapp.com and add additional customers to the "Reported by" field.

Every customer listed in the "Reported by" field will be notified in Slack and through email when the ticket is resolved.

4. Every customer listed in the "Reported by" field will be notified in Slack and through email when the task is resolved.

## Communicating with customers directly from a task

Across allows you to communicate with customers directly from a task. You no longer have to remember the right channel, thread, and customer to follow up with.

Every Slack thread associated with an Across task can be replied to directly from the task, or from the central #across_tasks channel.

## Integrating Across with other systems

Across can currently be integrated with Zendesk, Help Scout, Trello and Jira. These integrations are **two way, meaning that replies in the ticketing system are posted into Slack and vice versa.**
